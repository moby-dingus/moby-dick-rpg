# Moby-Dick the RPG

This is a pre-alpha version of Moby-Dick the RPG. Actually it's also mixed in with ren'py files because idk I'm just testing things out right now. I'm not even sure I should use ren'py for it. That may end up being more trouble than it's worth...

Note: I do not expect this commit of this repo, or really this repo at all, to survive into the future. It has a bunch of binary files I've included here just for reproducibility reasons.

Future possibility: there are some public domain illustrated versions of moby dick we can maybe use the character art of. see, for example: https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Moby_Dick_p91_illustration.jpg and https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Moby_Dick_p510_illustration.jpg
