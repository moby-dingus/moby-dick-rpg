# Moby-Dick the RPG

This is a pre-alpha version of Moby-Dick the RPG. Actually it's also mixed in with ren'py files because idk I'm just testing things out right now. I'm not even sure I should use ren'py for it. That may end up being more trouble than it's worth...

Note: I do not expect this commit of this repo, or really this repo at all, to survive into the future. It has a bunch of binary files I've included here just for reproducibility reasons.

Future possibility: there are some public domain illustrated versions of moby dick we can maybe use the character art of. see, for example: https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Moby_Dick_p91_illustration.jpg and https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Moby_Dick_p510_illustration.jpg

## Roadmap

Moby Dick planning document (epic)

Total time: maybe 30+50+50 = 130 ; 130 * 2 (hofstadter's constant) = 260 ; 260/8 = 32.5 man-days? If two guys work one solid day a week, that would be 16.25 weeks, or four months. Well, hard to say.

Ok, so, there are three components to Moby Dick the RPG (hence: M) : text, gameplay, and art.

Technical backend: I guess this is renpy for now. Could still pivot. Or just stay the course.

Text: it would take probably 30 hours to typeset all of M into renpy, assuming you also add various textual details (occasionally, the book has formatting), and also internal character tags. Most of it is just breaking on paragraphs, though. It's like 200,000 words.

Gameplay: turn-based RPG system. Kind of a combat puzzle for each thing. No dynamic carry-over progress, so you can do it like a book (I can see the case against this). This probably would not need additional art, except for maybe battle backgrounds) so it would just be the difficulty of programming it... maybe 50 hours? It also has to be designed. Fun, you might say.

Art:
Main characters (5 poses): could get away with maybe 3 of these tbh
Side character (1 pose): there are like 30 of these tbh.
Settings (backdrop): town (two towns), boat (two boats (The pequod is covered in whale ivory, so it looks different than every other boat)
Cutaways: need at least one whale shot, although this could be simply the whale character art.
Time estimate: I don't know

Marketing: I don't know.


Moby Dick the rpg additional features

1. Anime women mode (not lewd. Cute tho). And 
Public-domain illustration mode. normally it will just be original illustration mode

2. You can actually input other names for Ishmael &co

3. Wacky new-game plus? (Maybe make this a sequel or DLC)

4. Full 3d animated cutscenes (do not actually do this)
